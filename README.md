# garden-buddy-spikes

Repo usage guide:

1) No need to create new branch. Work on main

2) Create a new directory for each spike, and put all your files in here

3) Comment plenty, so that it's easy for the next person to see your process and findings

4) Even if you went down a path that didn't work, keep code in your spike, and write comments to say why it didn't work, and what your solution was
